  <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday.
     He may look happy, but he's a little disappointed. 
    Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.</p>  
<p>Jack would really like...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Roller blades</li>
    <li>Magic tricks</li>
    <li>Anything Pok√©mon</li>
    <li>A motorized Lego set</li>

</ul>
